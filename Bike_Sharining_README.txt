# Bike Sharing Assessment Analysis
This assignment is a programming assignment where in you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. 
Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, 
and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## General Information
- This project involves analyzing data from Bike-Sharing,Boom Bikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. 
  They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
-The main business problem is to minimize the risk of financial loss by identifying the critical features.
-The dataset includes information about past bike-sharing data includes wheather,humidity,cnt,windspeed,season etc.

## Business Understanding
The demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. 
They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations

## Business Objectives
-The Bike sharing company contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, 
they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. 
The company wants to know:
-Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
-How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Bike sharing Decession Scenarios
-The dataset that some of the variables like 'weathersit' and 'season' have values as 1, 2, 3, 4 which have specific labels associated with them
-The 'cnt' variable indicates the total number of bike rentals, including both casual and registered. The model should be built taking this 'cnt' as the target variable.
-There are three columns named 'casual', 'registered', and 'cnt'. The variable 'casual' indicates the number casual users who have made a rental. The variable 'registered' on the other hand shows the total number of registered users who have made a booking on a given day.

## Technologies Used
-Python - version 3.10.12
-Pandas - version 2.2.2
-Matplotlib - version 3.10.0
-Seaborn - version 0.13.2
-NumPy - version 1.26.4
-sklearn - version 1.6.1
-statsmodels - version 0.14.4
-scipy - version 1.13.1

## Conclusions
- Bike deamanding varies on the seasons on the year.
- Bike demands is high when humidity is low.
- Bike sharing company will be gain more when it depends on the windspeed,hum,temp,atemp variables.
